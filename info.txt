So this is the php code to make it work across multiple pages.
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shgr0ji71qI

1. create an 'assets' folder.
2. create a 'php' folder inside assets
3. create a navbar.html file inside the php folder
4. cut the navbar code into the file called navbar.html
	*I just need the tags, not the full head section or anything else
5. in its place type the following:
	<?php $IPATH = $_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"]."/assets/php"; include($IPATH."navbar.html"); ?>
	*first part creates a variable to the php folder location
	*second part puts the navbar code in the html page

6. If you need to add in a second chucnk of code then just use the second part again, as follows:
	<?php include($IPATH."footer.html"); ?>


how to link i think:
